Welcome to the reposiroty of OPSCC.net!
OPSCC.net is an open source tool that allows users to determine HPV-association in dedicated head and neck tumors. In its current version, OPSCC.net is built around the most used and most succesfull open-source tool for digital pathology (QuPath, at the time of commit at version 0.3.2), which has been built by Pete Bankhead from the The University of Edinburgh. You should visit this page if you have specific questions regarding QuPath. Actually, you should visit this page anyway because QuPath is a fantastic tool.
A big shoutout to Pete and his crew for making this available to the community.
Despite QuPath, OPSCC.net uses segmentation models for PyTorch, which has been built by Pavel Iakubovskii.
Parts of the code has been used and modified that I found
