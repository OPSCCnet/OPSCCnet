![Github Overview 1](https://github.com/OPSCCnet/OPSCCnet/blob/main/Github_overview_1.png)
Welcome to the reposiroty of OPSCCnet!
OPSCCnet is an open source tool that allows users to determine HPV-association in dedicated head and neck tumors. In its current version, OPSCCnet is built around the most used and most succesfull open-source tool for digital pathology (QuPath, at the time of latest commit at version 0.4.3), which has been built by Pete Bankhead from the The University of Edinburgh [Shoutout](#shoutout).

### ðŸš§ Requirements <a name="installation-req"></a>
Please consider that OPSCCnet has been tested using unix based systems (MacOS and Ubuntu). A GPU is advantegous but not necessary. OPSCCnet can be run using regular clients.\
Requirements: 
- [ ] Unix based system
- [ ] QuPath [anything above 0.3.1 should work, tested 0.4.3 at the time of latest commit] installed on your system
- [How to install QuPath 0.4.3](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/tag/v0.4.3)
- [ ] Anaconda (recommended) / Miniconda installed on your system 
- [How to install anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
- [ ] git installed / or manually downloaded the OPSCCnet repository 
- [How to install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OPSCCnet/OPSCCnet.git
```


### ðŸ§¨ Installation <a name="installation"></a>
```bash
conda create --name OPSCCnet python=3.9
conda activate OPSCCnet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OPSCCnet is using [paquo](https://github.com/bayer-science-for-a-better-life/paquo) to generate project files. It is necessary for paquo to know where QuPath is installed. Please [read the docs](https://paquo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) where to put the QuPath directory path in order to let paquo access it.

- [x] You have cloned / downloaded the OPSCCnet.git repository and installed the pip requirements
- [x] You have installed QuPath 0.4.3 (see above) on your system
- [x] You have put a reference of your QuPath APP to paquo (please read their docs) 

> You are ready to go
### ðŸŽ¯ How to run OPSCCnet <a name="hwtrun"></a>

```bash
streamlit run OPSCCnet.py
```
### ðŸŽ¯ Examples <a name="examples"></a>
![Github Overview 2](https://github.com/OPSCCnet/OPSCCnet/blob/main/Github_overview_2.png)
### OPSCCnet has essentially three parts:
- Segmentation of viable tumor areas using a FPN with a ResNet-18 encoder
- Classification of image tiles for HPV-association using a ResNet-18
- Visualizing HPV-association on whole slide level (WSI) and giving tabular data as output for individual WSI's

You should visit this [page](https://forum.image.sc/tag/qupath) which is a great ressource for questions regarding QuPath. Snippets and parts from scripts have been copied from there. 
- A big shoutout to Pete Bankhead and his crew for making this available to the community
- Recently, Pete Bankhead has published a [book](https://bioimagebook.github.io/README.html), I have not had the chance to take a look, but I would recommend it either way
- A big shoutout to segmentation models for PyTorch, which has been built by Pavel Iakubovskii
